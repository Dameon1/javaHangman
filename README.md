##Coding styles
I used two different styles to code the HTML.
-*JavaScript to perform loops, "if" statements, and a couple of getElemnetById's.
-*jQuery to make use of an easy to use catalog of options of changing the *HTML.

##Contributions
Contributions to the word bank are accepted. Please use all capital letters to maintain the ease of comparing inside the actual code.
If you have a design suggestion, I stayed with a simple Black & White design and will accept any improvements along those color lines.
If you have *Xcode experience and can make it accessible for iOS users if would be appreciated.
